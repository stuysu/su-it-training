# su-it-training
I reviewed over how to use git, and how the SU IT uses git.

Reviewed how to make a PR.

Reviewed that we need to test often!

# what-i-just-did
I checked out to a new branch, added this file, commited it, and then made a new PR and pushed.

I'm happy I'm learning more about this style of development!
