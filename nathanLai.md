# What i learned

- Dont use ai
- Have good naming habits for things like branches and commits

## what kind of black magic did i just do?

1. create new branch
2. checkout branch (done automatically thanks vscode)
3. add nathanLai.md
4. commit & push to branch
5. on github, create pr with branch
6. profit

### issues

- I did the exact thing I said I should improve in the nathanLai.md
