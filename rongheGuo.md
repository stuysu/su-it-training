# What I learned

I learned intro to git clone, pull and branches, pull requests, etc. My favorite ice cream flavor is choco chip. 

# What I just did

I just saved my changes to my branch of the remote repository, pushed, and created/merged a pull request. I encountered the challenge of procrastination along the way.
