# What I learned
I learned how to accept an issue on a repository and create a branch of a repository.

# What I just did
I created a second branch titled florence-training2 and edited this file, assigned myself to the pull request, and added a title and description to it. One challenge I encountered along the way was that I was not in the right repository when trying to run git branch, which confused me because the terminal threw a fatal error.
