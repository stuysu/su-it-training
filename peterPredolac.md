# SU IT Training Meeting 1

- I learned how to maneuver with terminal a little better, like using cat, md, cd, ls, and pwd to help navigate through folders and access folders.
- I struggled with following the wiki because I feel like some steps were left to the user to find out by himself, took a lot of trial and error.

# What I did

- I also cloned a repository on github and became better at opening files through terminal as well as debugging/tracking back all my steps and checking where I could have gone wrong.
