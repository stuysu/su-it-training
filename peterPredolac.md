# SU IT Training Meeting 1

- I learned how to maneuver with terminal a little better, like using cat, md, cd, ls, and pwd to help navigate through folders and access folders.
- I struggled with following the wiki because I feel like some steps were left to the user to find out by himself, took a lot of trial and error.
